Description

Now it is time to make a working game!

In the last stage, make it so you can play a full game with a friend. First one of you moves as X, and then the other one moves as O.

You need to create a game loop. The game starts with empty cells and ends when someone wins or there is a draw. You need to output the final result after the end of the game.

Good luck gaming!
